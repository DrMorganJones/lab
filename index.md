<h1>Welcome to the Academic Website of Morgan Jones</h1>

<p>
  I am a lecturer in Machine Learning and Control Theory at the University of Sheffield. My research interests lie at the intersection of control theory and machine learning, focusing on applications in robotics, system identification, and reinforcement learning.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
  My research spans multiple domains, including system identification, information theory, and AI safety. I am particularly interested in how control theory methods can be applied to machine learning and vice versa, with a focus on real-world applications in aerospace and robotics.
</p>
<p>
  Key areas of my work include:
  <ul>
    <li>Lyapunov functions in dynamical systems</li>
    <li>Reinforcement learning and multi-stage optimization</li>
    <li>System identification with physical constraints</li>
    <li>AI safety, including data poisoning in machine learning systems</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
  I teach several MSc courses in AI and machine learning at the University of Sheffield, and I am passionate about using innovative tools to support learning. Below you can find links to my interactive Google Colab notebooks, which I use in my teaching for hands-on learning and experimentation.
</p>

<h3>Interactive Lessons</h3>
